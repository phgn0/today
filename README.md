# What is this

A todo webapp that lets you plan tasks for the next few days. It stores the
tasks in the browser localStorage, so you can close the website and reopen it later.

# How to use it

Simply visit `today.phgn.de`, build it yourself with `yarn build` and open `./dist/index.html`, or start a dev server with `yarn start`.

# How does it work

It uses react for the ui, redux for data saving and webpack for the file bundling.
